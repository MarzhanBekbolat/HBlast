\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:concl}

In this work, we proposed an FPGA-based hardware accelerator targeting the BLAST algorithm. 
The proposed architecture supports both on-premises as well as cloud-based implementation of the algorithm.
Due to its parallel architecture, high-speed interfaces and lite-weight nature, the performance in terms of resource utilization and latency are much better than the state of the art.

In the future we intend to support more bioinformatic algorithms on reconfigurable platforms.
One of the immediate goals is to provide support for amino-acid sequence search.
The on-premises implementation source-code is available as an open-source IP core through our git repository~\cite{hblastGit}.
The AWS F1 implementation will be made available through the Amazon marketplace.
We believe that availability of open-source cloud-based bioinformatic accelerators will enable small research centers and hospitals to exploit the benefits of cloud-based hardware accelerators and get faster results within their time and cost constraints.

  Abstract                 = {A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score. Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straight-forward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

abstract = "Protein database search requests are generally being performed using the BLASTp algorithm, introduced by NCBI [1]. Since it is computationally intensive, it becomes more and more ine_ective with today's growth of sequence database sizes. The needs for an e_cient parallel implementation arise. In this paper, we focus on a massive parallelization using the FPGA-based hardware architecture RIVYERA [2]. The aim is to reach speedups in orders of magnitude with a flexible implementation while saving energy costs compared to PC-based database search. We keep our implementation close to the structure published by Kasap et al. [3], [4] and include ideas from Sotiriades et al. [5] such that all parts of the algorithm are organized in components of a long pipeline. We also use the idea of the two-hit method [6] to keep the computational e_ort small. Besides the related work, we perform the very last step of the algorithm to produce a gapped alignment with the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm in software, only with the option of hardware processing after reconfiguration. This saves FPGA-resources and allows an even higher degree of parallelism."
